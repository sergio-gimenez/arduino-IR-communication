\title{BER computation}

\date{\today}

\begin{document}

We have:
\begin{itemize}

  \item Expected received message: \(X = [x_{0}, x_{1}, ..., x_{N}]\).
   Where \(X\) is a 32 bit word randomly generated. \(N\) is the number
   of sent messages. \(x_{i}\) is a 32 bit word randomly generated. 
  
  \item Number of wrong bits in the each received message: 
  \(WB = [Wb_{0}, Wb_{1} , ..., Wb_{N}]\). Where \(Wb_{i} \)
  corresponds to the amount of errors in a 32 bit word, i.e each
  received message.

\end{itemize}

Then, the BER of each received message \(x_{i}\) is
\(BER_{i} = \frac{Wb_{i}}{32N}\) since all the received signals are
32 bit words. So we have a \(N\) dimension array of
\(BER\): \(BER = [BER_{0}, BER_{1}, ...,BER_{N}]\).

Then the average BER is:
\[BER_{AVG} = E\left\{BER\right\} = \frac{1}{32}E\left\{WB\right\}=\frac{1}{32}\sum_{i=0}^{N}\frac{1}{N}Wb_{i} = \frac{1}{32N}\sum_{i=0}^{N}Wb_{i}\]
